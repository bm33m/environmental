Kwakukhona ikhehla elalihama lithi, lithi.
Walihleka umfana waphenduka ikati! H. Ey'shi!

This AI Agent doesn't have any sense of humor! At least it could save some battery power. When the battery is flat, it could walk and talk like an old man, some crazy kids who have high sense of humor could laugh at it. That's the price you could pay for designing IoTs.

La durée en temps de parole, en veille, et le cycle de vic total d'une batterie rechargeable module pour AI Agent dépendra des conditions d'usage et des configurations résean.

As an electronics product, the AI Agent model should be able to perform at its optimum for a couple of months.

Statisticians could infer anything about anything. For example, the causes and effects of environmental problems. When you think about it environmental problems issues could affect anybody. If you are a politician for example, living in a big house with air conditions, you could write a long speech about global warming. The fact that you are already using an air conditioner, shows that there are already environmental problems issues and you are trying your best to mitigate them. Some environmental issues are natural, some are men made.

A case study is in order:

Few months after an earth quark at Esithilami, the unexpected did happen. The air quality did change. No vigorous testing could have dictacted this. All of a sudden the air was mixed with smoke, gas, dust, and other impurity material smell. Needless to say to many people were getting sick, ranging from sneezing, coughing, chest pain and other random unexpected problems. What could have happened is anybody's guesses. Esithilami was a very active mining area, with environmental sound policies. Mine dumps were all over the place. When there is a strong wind, dust flows all over the place. Unused old mines were used as dumping sites. Now and then fire broke out, fire fighters battle for days to distinguish it. When there are heavy rains some low line areas get flooded. Drainage system and gas pipe lines could have been damaged during earthquirks or during construction infrastructure upgrades. Gas pipelines could have been damaged during illegal mining activities and underground cable theft. If that was not enough mining companies were using powerful explosives to blast that golden rock, you could feel the the whole building shaking as if it was another earthquirk. Some companies were intensifying their production witch involved atmospheric emission.

How in the world could the poor AI Agent solve all of these complex environmental issues?

Come join us now as we build the AI Agent tool, multi purpose tool. State of the art AI Agent. This AI Agent tool is very optimistic about the future. Starting with DIY Engineering projects all the way to Environmental Engineering solutions. You can choose the futures you want to implement in your AI Agent tool.

Episode 26.

The AI Agent could ask, if Esithilami had sound environmental policies, how come they had so many environmental issues? To design and build the AI Agent system you got to be a jack of all trades! From faith to engineering, including science, business, politics, philosophy and more. All in one book, made up of episodes. The AI Agent asked a very good question. How come they had so many issues, if they had environmental sound policies? It's all about managing limited resources, space, time and human endeavours to satisfy their needs.

From a fresh and blood perspective, human beings are made up of fresh and blood. The space is full of obstacles. The first thing that the AI Agent could learn is obstacles avoidance.

When you compare the solar system with an atomic model you could get a better view of the abstract models and infer your own theories. The skye is still the safe limit for flesh and blood, human beings. Those who don't know their safe limits could find out the hard way. Of course most engineering solutions tries very hard to solve the flesh and blood, human beings limits. Atmospheric emission of fumes made from impure, toxic materials could have a negative effects on the safe sky and the flesh and blood, human beings.

Atmospheric emissions issues and policies are not only the local issues, but they are also a national and global issues. They don't have local or national boarders.

# Local and Global Edition.
Episode 27

DIY Project No. 27001
List some mission critical issues that you would like the AI Agent to solve.

Within the context of the Esithilami case study. The AI Agent could ask some questions. Why would the poor man steal the essential public infrastructure materials like copper cables, and the rich man buys them and sell them to the global market as as scrap material?

At some point in time the AI Agent should be able to answer it's own complex questions. At least it should learn how to answer complex questions. Machine learning do just that. But how? The AI Agent learns from its environmental and its surroundings. Within the environment space and time there are many actors and stake holders with diverse interest and diverse interest which are always competing for time. If that was not enough. Some environments were of prejudice, discrimination and inequalities. Some people called it the triple ills. Learning by your own mistakes could be destructive. Learning by the mistakes of others could be very destructive. Now that contradicts the fact that the AI Agent learns from its environment. It should not learn bad habits! But it should learn something good. The AI Agent have dilemma of nobody is perfect. What should it do? In search for role models? Politicians always point out corruption as the stumbling block to progress.
Gospel preachers always preach that everybody have sinned and have come short of the glory of God. And preach salvation by the son of God as the solution. Salvation involves believing and repentance.
Those who believe that Jesus Crist is the son of God and are baptized in the name of the Father, the Son and Holy Spirit shall be saves.

DIY Project No. 27002
From the risk management point of view, identify some risk isues within the design of the AI Agent System. List some ways to mitigate against them.

Now the AI Agent is ready to hit the ground running at last.
One can always fine tune the smooth operation of the system, in conjunction with the quality assurance team and the user's feedback.
With complex mission critical systems omissions, negligence or mistakes could cause critical errors or malfunction.
In a real world uncontrolled errors or mistakes could lead to accidents or system corruption. One should not throw the baby with bath water.Nobody said it was going to be easy. It is always easier said than done. Planning, designing, modeling, modernization, testing is the starting point. Innovation involves just that. It couldn't be easier, could it? Of course it can! Can it?

When designing the multilingual AI Agent tool, the AI Agent could have a hard time learning the phonetics of each language. No single language has monopoly over words. Some words are used in different languages with different sounds and meanings. For example, "into": in"TWO" for English and in"THO" for Zulu.
Words can also have several meanings. For example, when translating from English into French. Some words are derived from several other languages. For example, Moses, baptize, algebra, alphabet, pentavalence, hexadecimal, bit, monopoly, etc.
